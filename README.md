# Go Language Self-Study Plan

A comprehensive, structured self-study program for mastering Go programming from fundamentals to advanced concepts, based on the acclaimed **"Ultimate Go Programming, 2nd Edition"** course by Bill Kennedy.

## 🎯 Project Overview

This repository contains a meticulously crafted 38-module study plan designed to take you from Go beginner to advanced practitioner. Each module is structured for optimal learning with a balance of theoretical understanding and practical application through hands-on exercises focused on real-world automation scenarios.

### 📚 Course Attribution

This study plan is based on **"Ultimate Go Programming, 2nd Edition"** by **Bill Kennedy**, covering all 116 videos from the course plus modern Go 1.24/1.25 features.

> **⚠️ Important**: While this repository provides a structured learning path and supplementary materials, I **strongly recommend purchasing the official "Ultimate Go Programming, 2nd Edition" course** for the complete learning experience, including video content, official exercises, and instructor guidance. This repository serves as a companion study guide and should not replace the official course materials.

## 📋 Prerequisites

Before starting this study plan, ensure you have:

- **Programming Experience**: Basic programming experience in any language
- **Fundamental Concepts**: Understanding of variables, functions, loops, and basic data structures
- **Command Line**: Familiarity with command-line interfaces
- **Development Environment**: Access to a computer for hands-on practice

## 🛠️ Setup Instructions

### 1. Install Go

Download and install Go 1.24+ from [golang.org](https://golang.org/dl/)

**Windows (PowerShell):**

```powershell
# Download and install Go from official website
# Or use Chocolatey
choco install golang

# Verify installation
go version
```

**macOS:**

```bash
# Using Homebrew
brew install go

# Verify installation
go version
```

**Linux:**

```bash
# Download from golang.org or use package manager
sudo apt install golang-go  # Ubuntu/Debian
sudo yum install golang     # CentOS/RHEL

# Verify installation
go version
```

### 2. Set Up Development Environment

**Recommended IDE**: Visual Studio Code with Go extension

```powershell
# Install VS Code Go extension
code --install-extension golang.go
```

**Alternative IDEs**:

- GoLand (JetBrains)
- Vim/Neovim with vim-go
- Emacs with go-mode

### 3. Create Study Workspace

```powershell
# Create your study directory
mkdir go-study-workspace
cd go-study-workspace

# Initialize a Go module for exercises
go mod init go-study-exercises
```

### 4. Verify Setup

Create a simple test program:

```go
// main.go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    fmt.Println("Go study environment ready!")
}
```

Run it:

```powershell
go run main.go
```

## 📖 Usage Guidelines
